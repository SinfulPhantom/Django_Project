This is a learning project.
I have taken a strong interest in Python as well as Web Development, so I thought why not learn something that does both.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source. - https://www.djangoproject.com/

I am currently using TeamTreeHouse as a means of learning.
They use their own customized Workspace instead of Visual Studio. This makes learning it a little more difficult, but I've taken it into my own hands to incorporate VS into their lessons.

Feel free to look at how I use their lessons with VS to help you learn Django without their workspace.

This project is going to help me with future Web Development projects due to it being very quick and easy to get a Web Application up and running.
I'll be sure to post a link to future projects of mine that utilize the Django Framework.
